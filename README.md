# VTF Importer

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that allows the import of vtf source engine textures using VTFcmd.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [VTFimporter.dll](https://github.com/AlexW-578/VTF-Importer/releases/latest/download/VTFimporter.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Download [VTFcmd.exe](https://github.com/NeilJed/VTFLib/issues/11) | [Source Code](https://github.com/NeilJed/VTFLib) 
4. Unzip and navigate to vtflib132-bin\bin\x64
5. Copy the dlls and VTFCmd.exe to a folder called vtfLibs in the root of your Neos folder
6. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
